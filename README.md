## About The Project

![Screen Shot](/images/banner_panini.jpg)

I was bored, so I decided to help out the Chimpanzee Panini community, by creating a discord bot. In order that you know that the bot isn't a virus or anything, I created this open-source project.

## Built With

I built this bot with Node.js and Visual Studio Code. All my extensions are listed below:

Prettier (Formatter)
Discord.js (Bot)
Nodemon (Code Executor)
.env (To run environmental scripts)
